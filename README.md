## OVERVIEW

This is a demo of the first part of a program that will be of use for an election app. This first iteration of the program is written in JavaScript. This demo is expected to use good design, programming and testing practices. </br>

## DELIVERABLES

Design, write and test a MODEL that will be able to be used later in association with a VIEW </br>

1.	UML diagrams </br>
2.	Decide on the features that the program will have</br> 
3.	Develop appropriate tests</br> 
4.	Code and test</br> 

## FEATURES

Features of the MODEL are:</br> 
1.	Create a whole that acts as a Facade for parts</br> 
2.	Add a part</br> 
3.	Sort parts</br> 
4.	Filter parts</br> 
5.	Delete a selected part</br> 
6.	Save all parts to LocalStorage</br> 
7.	Load all parts from LocalStorage</br> 
8.	Update/edit a part</br> 
9.	Discard /revert edits to a part</br> 
10.	Validate inputs
11.	A calculation within a part
12.	A calculation across many parts
13.	Provide default values
14.	Find a part given a search criterion
15.	Get all parts
